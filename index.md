## Description

`findNeedles` counts and logs how many times particular `needles` (elements of the `needles` strings array) occur within `haystack` (string). To achieve that, `findNeedles` uses the `split` function dividing the `haystack` string into `words` strings by means of the following literals: `"`, `'`, `t`, `n`, `b`, `f`, `r`. `findNeedles` compares each element of the `needles` array to each element of the `words` array. It counts the matches and outputs them as a list of strings with numbers of their occurences.
